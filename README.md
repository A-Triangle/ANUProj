## A collection (?) of python for structural biochem 

# comparison.py

A simple program which will search string for known interactions with a specified protein, then return a series of fasta files with the sequence of the target and interacting proteins. 

# proj2.py 

some scripts i wrote to better analyse the alphafold structure of tnfaip3. (removes 'beads' from 'string' to focus on protein regions with function beyond being flexible linkers...)
